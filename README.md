## **About the Project**ðŸ‘€

This project aims to delve into the field of risk analytics within the banking and financial services sector. The primary focus is on understanding how various data-driven approaches can be employed to minimize the risk associated with lending. By examining key variables such as loan type, loan purpose, business or commercial nature, and credit score, the project seeks to identify factors that contribute to loan defaults. Additionally, the relationship between upfront charges, loan amounts, interest rates, and property values with default likelihood will be explored to uncover patterns and insights. Ultimately, **the goal is to enhance risk assessment strategies, leading to more informed decision-making and proactive measures in preventing loan defaults.**
